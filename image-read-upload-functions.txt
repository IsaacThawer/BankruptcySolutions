read-image.js

readImage(contID, filename) - input the container ID where the image needs to go, and the filename of the image file you're trying to read.

readImageBackground(contID, filename) - same as above, but this one sets the image as the container's background-image style.

*note: more functions may need to be made if images elsewhere use other style implementations


upload-image.js

uploadImage(e) - this function must first be added to a container as an EventListener (see top of upload-image.js for an example of this). The container it's added to must include an upload form where the user may upload a file and submit it (see dashboard.js for an example of this.) The container must also contain a "name" variable which has the filename the image is to be saved as.
