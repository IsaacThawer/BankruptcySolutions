My Wife and I had an awesome experience with Mr. Schwab. We found ourselves in a very unique situation and Mr Schwab bailed us out of a tough situation. When we where about 3 1/2 years into our 5 year chapter 13 our current lawyer died suddenly. I called several attorney's and no one would even speak to me. The reason was there really was no money to be made. That did not bother Mr Schwab. For a very modest fee he took on our case even though he might not make a penny. He was very honest about our situation and we appreciated that. We felt better knowing that we had legal help should we need it.<br>
