He showed me respect when I felt like an embarrassment to myself. Gina, his assistant was always on top of whatever needed to be filed with the court. She is extremely knowledgeable in her field, a consummate professional and a gem. They always promptly returned my calls and emails. They knew my name and about my case. I always felt that they had my back and cared about me and my case. When I had questions about anything, can I buy a new car?, can I sell my house? can I buy a new house? As it turned out, none of these things was a good idea for my specific case. Eric took the time to meet with me at the office directly to discuss it. He explained my options. He spoke to me in plain language and educated me on the law as pertaining to my case at the same time. With him and with Gina, no question was ever a dumb question.<br>
