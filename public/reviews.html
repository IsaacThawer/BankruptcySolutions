        <p>My Wife and I had an awesome experience with Mr. Schwab. We found ourselves in a very unique situation and Mr Schwab bailed us out of a tough situation. When we where about 3 1/2 years into our 5 year chapter 13 our current lawyer died suddenly. I called several attorney's and no one would even speak to me. The reason was there really was no money to be made. That did not bother Mr Schwab. For a very modest fee he took on our case even though he might not make a penny. He was very honest about our situation and we appreciated that. We felt better knowing that we had legal help should we need it. <br>- client name</p>

        <p>If you are looking for an attorney who will thoroughly educate you as to your options, whether they include filing bankruptcy or not, Eric Schwab is a great choice. He is extremely personable, non-judgmental and completely competent in this area of the law as he has been practicing it exclusively over 20 years, alone. In fact, if you are a business owner, he is an expert at analyzing Chapter 13 cases. You would think he would be expensive with all that knowledge and experience, but whatever your needs are, Chapter 7, 13 or 12, He is fair and reasonably priced. <br>- client name</p>

        <p>He showed me respect when I felt like an embarrassment to myself. Gina, his assistant was always on top of whatever needed to be filed with the court.  She is extremely knowledgeable in her field, a consummate professional and a gem. They always promptly returned my calls and emails.  They knew my name and about my case. I always felt that they had my back and cared about me and my case. When I had questions about anything,  can I buy a new car?, can I sell my house? can I buy a new house? As it turned out, none of these things was a good idea for my specific case.
          Eric took the time to meet with me at the office directly to discuss it. He explained my options. He spoke to me in plain language and educated me on the law as pertaining to my case at the same time. With him and with Gina, no question was ever a dumb question. <br>- client name</p>
