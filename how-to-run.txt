1. Install Node.js (if you don't already have it)

2. In terminal, open the directory where server.js is located and type the following:
	npm init -y				// this will create a package.json
	npm install express multer cors 	// install dependencies
	npm install --save dotenv 		// install dependencies
	node server.js				// run virtual server

3. Make sure you have a .env file in the root folder with the required key. The .env file must be excluded from your .gitignore and should not be uploaded into GitHub.	

4. open your web browser:
	to access the main website, go to address http://localhost:8000/
	to access the admin dashboard, go to address http://localhost:8000/admin/dashboard.html

		************ Troubleshooting*************
	If node server.js gives you an error after installing all the required dependencies above, try these:
	1- npm install @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb // install Dynamodb aws module
	2- cat package.json | grep '"@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb"' //check and confirm it is installed successfully
