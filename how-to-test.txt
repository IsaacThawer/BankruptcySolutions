1. Install the following dependencies:
	npm install --save-dev jest				// installs Jest (if it's already installed, you can skip this)
	npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom		// installs the required test environment

2. In package.json, find the "scripts" section and change the line "test" to read:
	"test": "jest",		// include quotes and comma

3. Open the directory where server.js is in terminal, and type:
	npm test	// this will run all test in the 'tests' file

   Alternatively, add the name of a test .js file to run a specific test
	npm test (testname).test.js
