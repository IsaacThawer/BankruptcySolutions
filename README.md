## Description
This project is a professional landing page for Bankruptcy Solutions by Eric Schwab, designed to provide clients with easy access to information and services. The website includes:
*   A homepage summarizing services, featuring the product owner's profile, and a consultation request form for quick submissions.
*   Sections showcasing client reviews, business hours, and a Google map for easy navigation.
*   An "About Us" page with detailed information about Eric Schwab’s background and his law practice.
*   An admin page for securely updating website content and managing client information.


**Technology stack**
* **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language): Structures the content and layout of the website, providing the foundation for all pages.
* **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles the website with custom designs, colors, and responsive layouts to ensure a visually appealing and mobile-friendly experience.
* **JavaScript** Adds interactivity, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and potential animations to enhance the user experience. This will be added in future revisions
